\usage{
clean(path, filename = "qualtrics.tsv", source_type = "qualtrics")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path relative to working directory that holds data in
designated "raw" directory, as well as the "clean" directory for written
data files.}

\item{filename}{The file name prefix for the raw data export from a given
source, and must include file extension (TSV). Defaults to "qualtrics_export.tsv".}

\item{source_type}{The source from which the raw data was exported from.
Defaults to "qualtrics".}
}
\description{
\code{clean} scrubs a list of raw response data consisting of participant
codes and images with category choices, where each list item is a TSV file
within a directory named "raw". The cleaned data is written to a new "clean"
directory with TSV files. Note that if you need finer control over the
cleaning of a given type of data export (i.e., Qualtrics), you should use that 
data export type's dedicated underlying method.
